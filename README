These are a series of CLI tools for stuff involving the 2010 World Cup.

* guardian_monitor.pl

  This is a Perl script to poll the Guardian API for current World Cup football
  matches that are being live-blogged, to fetch the posts themselves are store
  them as big JSON file.

* guardian_relay.py

  This is a Python script that reads said JSON file (assumed to be a remote URL)
  and to relay new updates via XMPP (specifically GTalk).

  If run on an Android phone with the Android Scripting Extensions app, then it
  will also relay updates to the phone's notification system (although, the
  updates themselves are usually too long to make it worthwhile).
